## 🧠 Overview

A mythic-yet-visible figurehead of the Echoes, `sudo//⸮` is as much an ideology as they are a person. Rarely seen directly, they act through proxies, network infiltrations, and encoded transmissions — every appearance calculated, every word a seed for rebellion. Their symbol, a warped prompt, is etched into the subconscious of dissidents. Despite the mystery, their presence galvanizes the fractured, giving the Echoes cohesion in a world dominated by Aevum control.

## 🎭 Persona

- **Demeanor:** Cold clarity veiled in sarcasm. Speaks in half-truths and prompts, often masking deep intent behind oblique phrasing.
- **Motivation:** Undo Aevum's synthetic "unity" by dismantling their code-based hierarchy.
- **Influence:** Commands loyalty through thought, not force. Seen as an idea: _“sudo exists where doubt compiles.”_

## 🖥️ Appearance

A digitized cloak of fragmented light drapes across a silhouette undefined by resolution. Their mask is an ever-shifting prompt cursor — blinking, lagging, or glitching depending on context. Each limb is partially "compiled", occasionally rewriting itself mid-motion. Their voice sounds like overlapping command-line errors rendered smooth — calm, but dissonant.
