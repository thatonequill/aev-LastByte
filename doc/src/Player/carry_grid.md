### ðŸ§Š **Carry Grid**

> *Your personal inventory system â€” grid-based, limited, and strategic.*

* **Grid-Based Inventory**: Items have physical sizes (1x1, 2x3, etc.) and must fit within the grid.
* **Limited Capacity**: The grid has a fixed number of tiles, upgradable via progression or perks.
* **Tetris-Style Management**: Rotate, rearrange, and optimize layout to carry more.
* **Quick-Use Bar**: Small sub-grid for instantly usable items (consumables, tools).
* **Compression Modules** *(Optional Upgrades)*: Temporarily reduce item size, at cost of cooldowns or energy.
* **Dimensional Storage**: One-way access to long-term storage â€” usable only at safe zones or hubs for retrieval.
