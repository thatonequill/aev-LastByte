Lunavar

Role:  
📜 Optional Story Quest Giver  
🧭 Guiding Presence during Main Story

Location:  
Various Meatspace regions — near ruins, forest altars, forgotten stone circles

Appearance:  
An ancient figure cloaked in layered, rune-woven fabrics that shimmer faintly in moonlight. Long silver hair flows freely; weathered face marked by quiet knowledge. Wears a belt of trinkets—stones, scrolls, feathers, crystal shards—each humming with dormant power. Carries a gnarled, twisted staff entwined with moss and sigils.

Personality:  
Calm, deliberate, cryptic. Speaks in poetic fragments, opposing control and erasure of ancient truths without direct allegiance.

Quest (Optional Story):  
🜁 “Embers of the Forgotten Weave”  
Tasks the player with cleansing the deeper corrupted regions of Meatspace from Aevum’s taint, leading to the fracture zone frx.Quanta裂.
