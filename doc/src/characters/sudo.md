## Overview

A mythic-yet-visible figurehead of the Echoes, `sudo//⸮` is as much an ideology as they are a person.
Rarely seen directly, they act through proxies, network infiltrations, and encoded transmissions — every appearance calculated, every word a seed for rebellion.
Their symbol, a warped prompt, is etched into the subconscious of dissidents. Despite the mystery, their presence galvanizes the fractured, giving the Echoes cohesion in a world dominated by Aevum control.

## Persona

-   **Demeanor:** Cold clarity veiled in sarcasm. Speaks in half-truths and prompts, often masking deep intent behind oblique phrasing.
-   **Motivation:** Undo Aevum's synthetic "unity" by dismantling their code-based hierarchy.
-   **Influence:** Commands loyalty through thought, not force. Seen as an idea: _“sudo exists where doubt compiles.”_

## Appearance

A digitized cloak of fragmented light drapes across a silhouette undefined by resolution. Their mask is an ever-shifting prompt cursor — blinking, lagging, or glitching depending on context. Each limb is partially "compiled", occasionally rewriting itself mid-motion. Their voice sounds like overlapping command-line errors rendered smooth — calm, but dissonant.

## Trivia

-   Never refers to themselves in the first person.
-   Known to manifest differently in Meatspace versus Glasspace, with rumors that they don’t physically exist at all.
-   Some Echoes say meeting `sudo//⸮` is like talking to your own inner monologue — one that's already made up its mind.
