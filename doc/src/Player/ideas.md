## stats
- Health, double system
    > Hit points for regular battles, turned into hearts for bosses `e.g. 10hp = 1 heart`, needs balancing but the idea is that
- Shield, same as health but with an other layer
    > Energy shields, for digital effect protections<br>
    > Magic Shields, for magical effect protections
- stealth?
- speed
    > Slight modifier for world movement<br>
    > Required at a certain level for the dash <br>
    > Mainly affects the priority of attack
- Strength
    > Flat attack stat
- Some kind of like "magic attack" stat
    > Efficency of Signatures
- Aether Battery
    > Stamina bar for Signature attacks, refilled after fights, dictates how much the player can dash (since its the dodge for boss fight)
