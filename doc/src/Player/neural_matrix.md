## ðŸ§  **Neural Matrix** â€“ Skill Tree Overview

The Neural Matrix is a **branch-based tech grid** unlocked through progress, quests, and leveling milestones. It offers **playstyle-defining bonuses**, new abilities, utility upgrades, and support systems.

### ðŸ”€ Structure

* Branches can **interconnect** at deeper levels, letting hybrid builds emerge.
* Some **locked sub-paths** require specific conditions (e.g. boss kills, quest flags).
* Progression costs **Neural Threads**, gained through level-ups, achievements, or rare upgrades.
