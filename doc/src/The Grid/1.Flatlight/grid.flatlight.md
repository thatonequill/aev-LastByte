# Flatlight

## `Aevum` - Tutorial - Shard 1

**Difficulty:** 🟦 <br>
**Realm:** Glasspace

---

### 🌐 **Area Description**
The first sector of the Glasspace the player explores, `grid.Flatlight` is a densely packed residential and working sector where apartments and businesses intertwine in seamless vertical stacks. Narrow corridors thread through the area with almost no alleys or open space, reinforcing an ever-present feeling of compression and control. Despite this, the sector is bathed in a soft, omnipresent glow—almost soothing, yet clinical.

Every surface gleams with efficiency; ads scroll in perfect timing, citizens walk with purpose, and every routine hums in harmony. It’s the artificial peace of a system working *too* well. Yet cracks appear—subtle data desyncs, flickers in signage, muted audio blips. The kind of inconsistencies you’re not supposed to notice.

It’s here that the player first encounters the Echoes, dissidents embedded in the system, who plant the seed of doubt. In Flatlight, nothing is overtly wrong—but something isn’t right.
