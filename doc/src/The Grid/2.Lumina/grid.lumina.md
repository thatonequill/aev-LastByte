# Lumina

## `Aevum` – Shard 2

**Difficulty:** 🟪 <br>
**Realm:** Glasspace

---

### 🌐 **Area Description**

The shimmering heart of the Glasspace’s residential grid, `grid.Lumina` is a vertical district of translucent towers, illuminated causeways, and silent, ever-efficient systems. It’s a showcase of Aevum’s societal blueprint: high-functioning, soft-lit, and seemingly without flaw. Life here is guided, not ruled—convenient, not coerced. Everything you need is within reach. Everything you might *want* is already provided.

Citizens walk in scheduled flows. Automated platforms adjust without query. Voices stay at polite volumes. The air is crisp, the data pure. But for the observant, strange details accumulate—imperceptible lags in transit, inconsistencies in personal logs, repeating patterns in conversation. You are not *hunted* here, but you are noticed.

Lumina is beautiful. Lumina is calm. Lumina is watching.

* **Unfreedom in abundance** — when everything is given, nothing is chosen.

## ➤ `trans.SignalBleed` – Transition: *Flatlight → Lumina*

> **Type:** Glasspace Transition <br>
> **Description:** <br>
> As Flatlight’s corridors fade behind you, the environment begins to glitch—not with violence, but with decay. Displays overlap for split seconds, system tones desync, and input fields flash and vanish. This is `SignalBleed`, the seam where code spreads thin. It’s not a corridor—it’s a soft fracture where one perfect simulation ends and another begins.
>
> Aevum’s system compensates instantly. Nothing ever breaks, only adjusts. But you saw it. And now you wonder what it didn’t want you to see.
