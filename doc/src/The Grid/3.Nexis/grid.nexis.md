# Nexis

## `Aevum` – Shard 3

**Difficulty:** 🟪 <br>
**Realm:** Glasspace

---

### 🌐 **Area Description**

Where Lumina radiates harmony, `grid.Nexis` *executes*. This is the operational backbone of the Glasspace—a sector built for runtime processing, low-tier enforcement, and background infrastructure. It doesn’t broadcast power; it simply *functions*. Towering data stacks pulse above conveyor arteries. Maintenance drones hum through corridors of polished steel.

Nexis isn’t where decisions are made—it’s where they're implemented.

Enforcement here is procedural, not aggressive. Rules are embedded in the architecture. Platforms respond to threat levels. Paths lock down preemptively. It's not personal—it's protocol. Any threat, even unintentional, is flagged and handled before it escalates.

Still, some processes aren’t running cleanly. Empty patrol loops repeat endlessly. Maintenance units misroute into zones long deprecated. And beneath the structure, a quiet anomaly—a recursive delay spike—continues to expand.


### 🧩 **Narrative Role**

* First real encounter with systemic enforcement.
* Players learn that the Glasspace doesn’t only *look* controlled—it is.
* Sets tone for Aevum’s detachment: peace is a product, not a feeling.


### ⚙️ **Gameplay Features**

* Combat encounters emerge from industrial layouts—trap floors, rotating turrets, redirect nodes.
* Puzzle mechanics involve timing and signal disruption.
* System overrides must be synchronized across distant terminals.
* Enemies respond to inputs—not presence—reinforcing the feeling of logic over emotion.

### 🧠 **Thematic Notes**

* **If Lumina is the showroom, Nexis is the server room.**
* **Enforcement ≠ violence** — authority here is logical, not angry.
* **Function ≠ safety** — you're in the system, but you're not part of it.

### 📍 **See also the Nodes**

**Theme Summary:**
Nexis is the execution layer of the Glasspace—where code becomes command. Here, citizens don’t live—they process. Structures enforce logic through architecture. Nothing asks; everything *executes*.

#### `node.LoadBalancer`

> Arrival zone for drones, parcels, and pre-cleared citizen movement. Nothing here stops—only reroutes.

#### `node.FlowNest`

> Vents hum with unbroken rhythm. Access corridors echo with routines no one monitors—but never stop.

#### `node.AutoPrism`

> You’re not hunted—you’re prevented. Pathways isolate. Floors drop. You’re flagged, logged, neutralized.

#### `node.FlagPulse`

> Not an enemy—a subroutine that doesn’t understand why you’re still moving.
> *Later known as `axi.FlagPulse` (Boss Node)*

## ➤ `trans.MemoryLeak` – Transition: *Lumina → Nexis*

> **Type:** Transition <br>
> **Description:**<br>
> You weren’t meant to find it—but you did. A soft glitch trails behind an ad banner, drifting down like a memory that forgot its anchor. You follow it.
>
> The path leads behind sealed maintenance access, into a corridor that shouldn’t exist. On the wall, just before the falloff: a silent tag burned in faint static.
>
> `run.memory∖leak_detect() // containment bypassed`
>
> This is no coincidence. Someone made this leak *visible*. You slip into Nexis not through authorization, but anomaly.
>
> It smells like burnt circuits. And something waiting.
