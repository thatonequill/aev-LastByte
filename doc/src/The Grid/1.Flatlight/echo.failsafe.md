## 🧾 Description

A tucked-away service tunnel repurposed by the Echoes. Here, compression relents slightly. The lighting is dimmer, warm, and chaotic—organic compared to the sterile geometry of the system.

This is your first contact with Echo tech, graffiti-like glyphs scrawled across panels and jagged vents pried open manually.
