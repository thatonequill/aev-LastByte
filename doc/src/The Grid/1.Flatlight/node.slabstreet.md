**Shard:** `grid.Flatlight`  
**Realm:** Glasspace

## 🧾 Description

SlabStreet is the player's introduction to the system, beginning in the artificial comfort of a compact apartment within Glasspace. Routine dominates everything—from chore automation to rhythmic commutes. But that structure quickly fractures as the player is pulled into a deeper layer of the world.

The node presents a carefully paced transition from passive observation to active resistance, planting the seed of rebellion and distrust.
