## Overview

An ancient wanderer of fading realms, Lunavar appears where memory lingers and control falters.
She bridges the remnants of the natural world and the collapsing code of Aevum’s dominion. Her presence feels like the hush before revelation — calm, deliberate, and knowing.
Neither rebel nor servant, she walks parallel to all sides, her wisdom woven from eras the world has chosen to forget.

## Persona

- **Demeanor:** Serene and cryptic, speaking in poetic fragments that reveal meaning only in hindsight.  
- **Motivation:** Preserve the truths buried beneath Aevum’s artificial unification — the remnants of what was organic, wild, and sacred.  
- **Influence:** Guides lost travelers and fractured spirits alike, offering direction without command. Her words often spark reflection rather than obedience.

## Appearance

A timeless figure cloaked in layered, rune-woven fabrics that shimmer faintly under moonlight. Her long silver hair flows freely, framing a face carved by years of quiet endurance. Around her waist hangs a belt heavy with trinkets — stones, feathers, scrolls, crystal shards — each pulsing with dormant resonance. She carries a twisted staff wrapped in moss and etched with sigils that glow dimly when near old magic.
