## Echo Nodes

### Failsafe

This area is the hideout, the safe zone. A heaven of peace and freedom within Aevum's domain. This is where the player can trade, rest, craft, upgrade and assign skills.

-   `Layout`: A large, rectangular room with tables in the back wall, those tables are the upgrade / crafting / other stations. The area is filled with Echoes going by. In the very ccenter of the main room, there is a large, circular table with an holographic map of the explored grid.
    The far left of the room ends in a corridor, leading to the residential area of the hideout, where the player can rest and interact with quest giving Echoes.
    The far right of the main room has a door in the back wall, leading to `Recompile`, the training ground. The right wall ends in a little corridor, leading to the map selection screen.

-   `Vidual design`: The hideout is luminous, with a purple hue. The assets and walls are visually degrading, with bits and squares bright white floating up and disappearing. The floor is a dark blue, with a neon blue grid pattern. Metalic assets are a dark purple color.

### Recompile

This area is the training ground. A place where the player can train and test their skills.

-   `Layout`: Its a bear empty and white room, with observation pods in the back wall. There is a button towards the middle of the room, which allows the player to choose a simulation to train in.
